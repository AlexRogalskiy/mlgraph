# MLGraph

MLGraph defines a graph of machine learning components. The goal is to provide a simple machine learning focused 
specification for defining:

  * A/B Tests and multi-model experimentation
  * Advanced optimization with Multi-Armed Bandits
  * Model Ensembles


An example graph:

## Definitions
 
  * [Control plane](docs/control-plane.md)
       * [Examples](docs/examples.md)
  * [Data plane](docs/data-plane.md)

## Implementations

   * A [KNative implementation proposal](docs/knative-impl.md) 


## Discussion

The spec is a live document.

   * [Discussion Points](./docs/discussion.md)
